Changes for version 1.7
=======================

Added "manual" as a legal argument for the "bb" (bounding box) option. When specified, the bounding box of the figure will be set based on the values provided with the following options:
- bb_width: The width of the bounding box, in inches.
- bb_height: The height of the bounding box, in inches.
- bb_x_offset: The x offset of the bounding box, in inches.
- bb_y_offset: The y offset of the bounding box, in inches.
- bb_x_center_includes_labels: If True, take the figure labels into account when horizontally centering the bounding box. If false, ignore the labels when horizontally centering.
- bb_y_center_includes_labels: If True, take the figure labels into account when vertically centering the bounding box. If false, ignore the labels when vertically centering.

Changes for version 1.6
=======================

Added options for creating an inset for a figure. The options are:
- inset_stats: Which statistic to plot in the inset. See the stats option for legal arguments.
- inset_x: The x-coordinate of the left side of the inset in figure coordinates.
- inset_y: The y-coordinate of the bottom side of the inset in figure coordinates.
- inset_w: The width of the inset.
- inset_h: The height of the inset.
- inset_area_x1: The smallest x-value for the data covered in the inset (in data coordinates).
- inset_area_x2: The largest x-value for the data covered in the inset (in data coordinates).
- inset_area_y1: The smallest y-value for the data covered in the inset (in data coordinates).
- inset_area_y2: The largest y-value for the data covered in the inset (in data coordinates).
- inset_labels: Which tick-labels to show. Current options are 'all' and 'none'.
- inset_labels: Which ticks to show. Current options are 'all' and 'none'.
- inset_lines_visible: Which lines to show for indicating the inset area. Current options are 'all' and 'none'.

Changes for version 1.5
=======================

- Split the box_sep parameter into a box_margin_before and a box_margin_between parameter, allowing you to define the the space between the main plot and the significance indicator boxes and between the significance indicator boxes separately.
- Add the "bb" option, which allows you to determine how the bounding-box is calculated, which should make it easier to create two plots with the exact same dimensions. The options are default, tight, and custom. Here, default is the default bounding box, which leaves a lot of white-space and may not capture all labels, but it is guaranteed to have the correct aspect ratio. Tight will prune the bounding box to remove whitespace and include labels originally outside of the bounding box, but it will not preserve the original aspect ratio. Custom manually calculates the bounding box to remove most white space (but not as much as the tight layout) while preserving aspect ratio.
- Renamed the sig_label to sig_header and allow it to be shown as a header with sig_header_show (instead of being prepended to each of the significance box labels). If it is shown as a header, it can be offset with sig_header_x_offset and sig_header_y_offset, and its font size can be modified with sig_header_font_size.
- Updated the cache file reading to verify the step size in the cache, and throw an error if the step size of the cache does not match the step size of the configuration file. This does not work when the generation is read from file.


Changes for version 1.4
=======================

New options:
- Added the sig_lbl_add_treat_name option, allowing control over whether to show the treatment name next to the significance indicator bar.
- Added the sig_treat_lbls_show option, allowing control over whether to show the other treatment names on the other side of the significance indicator bar.
- Added title_font_size as an alias for the title_size option, to correctly indicate that this refers to the font size of the title.
- Added the plot_confidence_interval_border option, which makes the confidence interval regions more visible by drawing a border around them.
- Added the confidence_interval_border_style option, which allows for changing the style of the confidence interval border.
- Added the confidence_interval_border_width option, which allows for changing the width of the confidence interval border.
- Added the confidence_interval_alpha option, which allows for changing the alpha of the shaded confidence interval regions.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed a bug where the bounding box of plot could be affected by elements added to a previous plot.
- Fixed a bug where the labels next to the significance indicator bar would only be considered for the bounding box if the plot had a legend.
- Fixed a bug where the line style could no longer be set for all treatments at once.
- Fixed a bug where the significance marker could not be set for all treatments at once.
- Fixed a bug where comparisons between treatments would appear in the opposite order in which they were provided.


Changes for version 1.3
=======================
Added the ability to compare against multiple main treatments. New options were added to enable this functionality:
- comparison_main: Specify the main treatments to compare against. Specify multiple main treatments to perform multiple statistical comparisons.
- comparison_others: For every main treatment the program should define a number of other treatments the main treatment should be compared against. The empty string specifies a comparison against all other treatments.
- comparison_height: Every statistical comparison gets its own box below the plot. This parameter defines the relative height of this box.
For the comparison_main and comparison_others options, treatments can be indicated by their index or by their treatment name (both their long name and their short name).

The background_colors option now has a new alias "treatment_bgcolor", which should look nicer in configuration files. In addition, the background_colors option now accepts the string "default", which indicates to the program that the background color should be calculated normally rather than specified explicitly. This options is useful when you have multiple treatments, but you only want to specify the background color for one treatment, and have the other treatment colors be determined as normal (due to how options work, if you want to specify the background color for one treatment, you will have to specify the background color for all treatments.


Changes for version 1.2
=======================
Added customization options for the treatment names next to the significance indicator box. New options are:
- sig_treat_lbls_x_offset: Moves labels horizontally.
- sig_treat_lbls_y_offset: Moves labels vertically.
- sig_treat_lbls_rotate: Rotates labels.
- sig_treat_lbls_symbols: Shows symbols in stead on labels (old style).
- sig_treat_lbls_font_size: Changes the fontsize of the labels.
- sig_treat_lbls_align: Changes the alignment of the labels.

The sig_treat_lbls_align option is to be used in combination with the rotate option. If rotate upwards (positive angle), you want the alignment to be bottom.
If rotate downwards (negative angle), you want the alignment to be top.


Changes for version 1.1
=======================
- Linestyle can now be set for each treatment.
- Better default positioning for the label next to the significance indicator box.

Current version: 1.7
Last updated on: Jun. 27 2018

Changes for version 1.7
=======================
- Added the CacheError as an additional exception that can be thrown.
- Added a helper function for retrieving a renderer from Matplotlib, which can resolve some issues with respect to the "tight layout" option.

Changes for version 1.6
=======================
- The getFloatDefFirst function now properly casts the first value to a float, rather than returning it as a string.

Changes for version 1.5
=======================
- Added the get_treatment_index and parse_treatment_ids helpers functions for referring to treatments by their name, rather than there index.
- Added a couple of additional getter functions for the global options, such as: getFloatDefFirst, getIntDefNone, and getFloatList. Planning a refactor of these functions, as we have a few too many at this point.


Changes for version 1.4
=======================
- The --version option now prints the version number of both the invoked tool, and the plot utilities.
