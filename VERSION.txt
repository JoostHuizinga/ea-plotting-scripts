Current version: 1.3
Last updated on: Mar. 8 2018

Changes for version 1.3
=======================
Added the ability to compare against multiple main treatments. New options were added to enable this functionality:
- comparison_main: Specify the main treatments to compare against. Specify multiple main treatments to perform multiple statistical comparisons.
- comparison_others: For every main treatment the program should define a number of other treatments the main treatment should be compared against. The empty string specifies a comparison against all other treatments.
- comparison_height: Every statistical comparison gets its own box below the plot. This parameter defines the relative height of this box.
For the comparison_main and comparison_others options, treatments can be indicated by their index or by their treatment name (both their long name and their short name).

The background_colors option now has a new alias "treatment_bgcolor", which should look nicer in configuration files. In addition, the background_colors option now accepts the string "default", which indicates to the program that the background color should be calculated normally rather than specified explicitly. This options is useful when you have multiple treatments, but you only want to specify the background color for one treatment, and have the other treatment colors be determined as normal (due to how options work, if you want to specify the background color for one treatment, you will have to specify the background color for all treatments.


Changes for version 1.2
=======================
Added customization options for the treatment names next to the significance indicator box. New options are:
- sig_treat_lbls_x_offset: Moves labels horizontally.
- sig_treat_lbls_y_offset: Moves labels vertically.
- sig_treat_lbls_rotate: Rotates labels.
- sig_treat_lbls_symbols: Shows symbols in stead on labels (old style).
- sig_treat_lbls_font_size: Changes the fontsize of the labels.
- sig_treat_lbls_align: Changes the alignment of the labels.

The sig_treat_lbls_align option is to be used in combination with the rotate option. If rotate upwards (positive angle), you want the alignment to be bottom.
If rotate downwards (negative angle), you want the alignment to be top.


Changes for version 1.1
=======================
- Linestyle can now be set for each treatment.
- Better default positioning for the label next to the significance indicator box.

Current version: 1.5
Last updated on: Mar 8 2018

Changes for version 1.5
=======================
- Added the get_treatment_index and parse_treatment_ids helpers functions for referring to treatments by their name, rather than there index.
- Added a couple of additional getter functions for the global options, such as: getFloatDefFirst, getIntDefNone, and getFloatList. Planning a refactor of these functions, as we have a few too many at this point.


Changes for version 1.4
=======================
- The --version option now prints the version number of both the invoked tool, and the plot utilities.
