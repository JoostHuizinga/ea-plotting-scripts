Changes for version 1.2
=======================
Added customization options for the treatment names next to the significance indicator box. New options are:
- sig_treat_lbls_x_offset: Moves labels horizontally.
- sig_treat_lbls_y_offset: Moves labels vertically.
- sig_treat_lbls_rotate: Rotates labels.
- sig_treat_lbls_symbols: Shows symbols in stead on labels (old style).
- sig_treat_lbls_font_size: Changes the fontsize of the labels.
- sig_treat_lbls_align: Changes the alignment of the labels.

The sig_treat_lbls_align option is to be used in combination with the rotate option. If rotate upwards (positive angle), you want the alignment to be bottom.
If rotate downwards (negative angle), you want the alignment to be top.


Changes for version 1.1
=======================
- Linestyle can now be set for each treatment.
- Better default positioning for the label next to the significance indicator box.

Current version: 1.5
Last updated on: Mar 8 2018

Changes for version 1.5
=======================
- Added the get_treatment_index and parse_treatment_ids helpers functions for referring to treatments by their name, rather than there index.
- Added a couple of additional getter functions for the global options, such as: getFloatDefFirst, getIntDefNone, and getFloatList. Planning a refactor of these functions, as we have a few too many at this point.


Changes for version 1.4
=======================
- The --version option now prints the version number of both the invoked tool, and the plot utilities.
